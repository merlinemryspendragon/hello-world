# hello-world
My first repository
Hey, I'm designing a website for a club and wanted to host the draft somewhere. I heard github was helpful for this. I'm really enjoying website creation- more than I though I would- so I'll probably replace the draft with my own website that I will work on later. I'm really looking forward to that!
